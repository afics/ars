# Automated Resource Scheduling (ARS)

This tool distributes compute resources (VMs, containers, or anything else)
according to available hardware resources, load and configured constraints. It
populates a model which is subsequently solved using a SAT solver from OR-tools
[0]. Run it by executing main.py in a loop every few minutes. It looks for its
configuration in a file named ars.cfg in the current working directory.

With regards to resource usage both CPU and memory utilization are considered.
Supported constraints are:
  - VM-to-VM (Resource-to-Resource)
  - VM-to-Host (Resource-to-Compute-Node)
Both support affinity (keep-together, run-on) and anti-affinity (keep-apart,
run-elsewhere). Example configurations show casing this can be found in the
examples/ directory.

**WARNING**: This tool is highly EXPERIMENTAL. Altough it is used daily by its
creator, it is not recommended to use it in production environments. It is
missing documentation, logging and tests.

Currently supported is Proxmox VE, but the tool is supposed to be easily
extendable to other systems.
